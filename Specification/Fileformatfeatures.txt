Required for beatmap:
BPM
BPS (calculated from BPM)

(if BPM isn't specified already)
BPM = number of beats in song times 60 divided by the number of seconds in song
in code:
BPM = (num beats in song) * 60 / (num secs in song)

"The BPM provides a foundation on which you can start testing for user inputs."


Songs are assumed to be in commom time (4/4), which is needed for input accuracy
(eighth-note does well, but sixteenth/sixty-fourth is for more complicated beatmaps)
