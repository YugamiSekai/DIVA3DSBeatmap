Required for beatmap:
BPM
BPS (calculated from BPM)

(if BPM isn't specified already)
BPM = number of beats in song times 60 divided by the number of seconds in song
in code:
BPM = (num beats in song) * 60 / (num secs in song)

"The BPM provides a foundation on which you can start testing for user inputs."


Songs are assumed to be in commom time (4/4), which is needed for input accuracy
(eighth-note does well, but sixteenth/sixty-fourth is for more complicated beatmaps)


For constant press levels:
Every note should appear in an array.


If using sixteenth notes as a input sequenceâ€™s precision:
Array beats = [ 4, 8, 12 ]; // 1st, 2nd, 3rd quarter note


For each quarter note, there are four sixteenth notes.  The array above says to detect the first, second and third sixteenth-note of each bar, so each value (quarter note) is multplied by four to get its corresponding value in sixteenth notes.

To calculate note position:
nth sixteenth-note = (time in secs in song) * BPM * (1/60) * (num_vals_per_beat)

Quoted from Illogictree:
"Say your song loop is only 10 seconds long but the game has elapsed a total time of 14 seconds. That means the local time of the song loop is 14-10=4 seconds."
